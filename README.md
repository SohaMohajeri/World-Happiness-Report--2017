The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. This report reviews the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll.

The dataset that we have chosen is Happiness Dataset 2016, one of Kaggleâ€™s dataset. This dataset gives the happiness rank and happiness score of 155 countries around the world based on factors including family, health, economy, generosity, trust in government, freedom, country, region and dystopia residual.

There are three parts to my report as follows:

Feature Engoineering
Visualization
Prediction
Our first objective is to determine factors that are more important to live a happier life. Our second purpose is to implement several machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression and XGBoost Regression to predict the happiness scores throughout the world. We will compare the results to discover which algorithm works better for this specific dataset.
